In your workstation, you need to have the following softwares installed:

- [Salesforce CLI](https://developer.salesforce.com/tools/salesforcecli)
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
  with the pluggins:
  - [GitLens](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=eamodio.gitlens)
  - [Salesforce Extension Pack (Expanded)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=salesforce.salesforcedx-vscode-expanded)

## Org Development Model

The org development model allows you to connect directly to orgs (being source-tracked like scratch orgs or not, like some sandboxes, Developer Edition (DE) org, Trailhead Playground, or even a production org) to retrieve and deploy code directly. This model is similar to the type of development you have done in the past using tools such as Force.com IDE or MavensMate.
